* Modify Session so that it uses Identity::Controllers::TokensController for requesting tokens

* Think about re-arranging the files/namespace to RedStack::<Service>::<Layer> (e.g. RedStack::Identity::Controllers)

* Extract common code in controllers and move to ArrayController and ObjectController

* Consider moving service-specific session methods to their own files?

* Clean up gems, fix .ruby-version, .ruby-gemset files
